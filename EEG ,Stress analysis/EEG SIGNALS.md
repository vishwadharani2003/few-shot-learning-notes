how does the EEG data look like
![[Pasted image 20240113162457.png]]
signals from the areas of the brain in left axis
and the time in x-axis

existence of EEG is known while the content of the EEG signals are unknown(something that we are working towards and making progress)

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Advantages of EEG:</mark>
- Direct measure of electrical brain activity
- temporal resolution and precision match the speed of cognition
- we need to measure the brain at what speed the cognition occurs
- Richness (lots of data packed into it) of the data allow for physiologically inspired analyses (oscillations ,synchronization,connectivity,complexity/scale-free)

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Disadvantages of EEG</mark>
- u cant measure the activity of the single neuron
- u will be able to measure only the electrical fields,if the two opposite electrical fields are near by they will cancel each other and no electric field be present there
- ![[Pasted image 20240113164509.png]]
- uncertainties in anatomical localization
- data ,analyses ,statistics and visualization are complicated ,time consuming and annoying
- high temporal precision and resolution
- 
difference between processing and pre-processing
- what all the pre- processing thing that u need to data to get to processing(analyzing) step
- preprocessing ->  time consuming,tedious,not science, probably not fun,u never need to do preprocessing again
- processing->hypothesis driven ,exploratory,the meat of science,hopefullly lots of fun,often done multiple times

EOG->electrode near the eye
EKG->measuring the heart activity
EMG->measure the muscle activity


- upto point 4 the the data is two dimensional 
- after 4 the data is 3 dimensional
artifacts are very unusal and it should removed from the data ->adjust marker values
broken electrode will be containing noise->mark bad electrode
